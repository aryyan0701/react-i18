# Multilingual React App

Welcome to the Multilingual React App! This project demonstrates how to implement multilingual feature in a React application using the i18next library. It supports multiple languages and provides a seamless language-switching experience for users.

## Features

- **Language Detection:** Automatically detects the user's language preferences and switches the app's language accordingly.
- **Multiple Languages:** Supports English, Hindi, Marathi, and Gujarati.
- **Dynamic Language Switching:** Allows users to change the app's language dynamically through a language selector.
- **RTL Support:** Handles right-to-left languages like Arabic for proper text direction.

## Tech Stack

- **React.js:** Used as the frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Used for styling the user interface with customizable and reusable classes.
- **i18next:** Manages translations.
- **i18next-browser-languagedetector:** Detects the user's language preferences from various sources.
- **react-i18next:** Provides React bindings for i18next, enabling translation hooks in React components.
